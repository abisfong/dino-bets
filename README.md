# **Dino Bets**
## Background
<p>
Dino Bets is based on a tradition established by cohort 2021-08-30-SF in which
people would guess on what dinosaur or in what sequence the dinosaurs would win 
in a Dino Race. Dino Race is an online timer (https://www.online-stopwatch.com/dino-race/)
that displays an animated race between 2 to 4 (or 2 to 100 if you pay for a 
subscription) dinosaurs. A random dinosaur wins everytime.
<br><br>
Dino Bets will be an implementation of this tradition. Start a timer and place a
bet or simply enjoy the race!

<!-- Dino Bets:
Dino Bets will be an implementation of the game we play in Zoom chat with Dino Timer. The Dino Race will be displayed on a host screen that players can connect to. Each player can place a bet in the following forms:

Win Bet: a bet on a Dino to finish first
Place Bet: a bet on a Dino to place first or second
Show Bet: a bet on a Dino to place in the money (first, second, or third)
Sequence Bet: a bet on the order of the positions each Dino will place in

All players start with the same amount of money to bet. If a bet is won, the winner(s) get the amount of money they bet divided by the probability of their bet. For example, in a race of 4 dinos, a sequence bet would have the probability of 1/4!. Then, winning that bet would result in (betAmount / (1/4%)) or (betAmount * 4!).

The winner of the Dino Bet is the person with the most money at the end of the race.
