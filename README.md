# **Dino Bets**
## Background
<p>
Dino Bets is based on a tradition established by cohort 2021-08-30-SF in which
people would guess on what dinosaur or in what sequence the dinosaurs would win 
in a Dino Race. Dino Race is an online timer (https://www.online-stopwatch.com/dino-race/)
that displays an animated race between 2 to 4 (or 2 to 100 if you pay for a 
subscription) dinosaurs. A random dinosaur wins everytime.
<br><br>
Dino Bets will be an implementation of this tradition. Start a timer and place a
bet or simply enjoy the race!
</p>
